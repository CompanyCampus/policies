# Citizen Code of Conduct

## 1. Purpose

A primary goal of the Company Campus is to be inclusive to all, with the most
varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to
providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of
gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and
religion (or lack thereof).

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate
in Company Campus, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

We invite all those who participate in the Company Campus to help us create
safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## 2. Open [Source/Culture/Tech] Citizenship

A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open
[source/culture/tech] citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and
strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects in the
Company Campus.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist and positive action is
essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that
exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure that the Company
Campus is welcoming, friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute
to the fullest extent, we want to know.

## 3. Expected Behavior

    the health and longevity of Company Campus.

  * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert
    Company Campus leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in
    distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem
    inconsequential.

## 4. Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive,
discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant
in Company Campus online, at all related events and in one-on-one
